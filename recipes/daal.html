    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Daal is a popular South Asian dish enjoyed throughout the world. Daal is an umbrella term 
            for a variety of different pulses and lentils as well as the cooked soup-like dish. However,
            especially in diasporic communities, the cooked dish of daal is made with split mung bean lentils.

        <p>The preparation of the dish varies from family and communinity. If you 
            do follow this recipe the first time and enjoy it, I highly recommend
            you adjust it the next time you make it to add a personal twist!
