    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Raita is a popular side dish from South Asian cuisine. It is 
            enjoyed with a variety of spicy and flavorful dishes because
            of its smooth texture and cooling, tart taste. Like many South Asian dishes,
            raita can be customized for your tastes and needs, or whatever you have
            on hand!</p>
        <p>This recipe is a simple raita with a few ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the base:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup of curd or yogurt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Optional ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Grated cucumber</li>
                <li>Chopped parseley</li>
                <li>Chopped cilantro</li>
                <li>Diced tomato</li>
                <li>Diced red onion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The optional ingredients can be added in any amount.
                I didn't include any quantity because, really, it is pretty
                much just eyeballing and seeing what you like or don't. Even
                the base raita by itself is so tasty,
            </p>
